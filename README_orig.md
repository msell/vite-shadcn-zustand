**Fold frontend tech challenge**

The aim of this challenge is for us to see how you go about solving coding problems.
The challenge is for you to create a cart and checkout experience. We are only interested in the code and not so much the ui/design.
- Please scaffold your app using create react app.
- You are free to add any libraries that you feel will help in your solution e.g. redux, typescript etc...
- Add unit tests where you feel appropriate - don't go crazy
- Update the readme to reflect any thoughts you might have e.g what you would do if you had more time that sort of thing
- Have fun!

**Product List Page:**

Create a page that contains a list of Products. The products will usually be pulled from an api but these can be hard coded - see `api/product.json`

* As a user, I need to be able to see a list of products. Include `title`, `image`, `description` and `price`
* As a user, I need to be able to add products to my cart.


**Navigation Bar**

Create a nav bar with 2 links to the Product List Page and the Checkout Page.

* As a user, I should be able to go back and forth between the pages whilst preserving the state of the basket.

** (optional) every time the user adds an item you can display numbers of items in the cart.


**Cart Page**

Create a page that displays the contents of the cart

* As a user, I should be able to see the various items I have added and their quantities.

* As a user, I need to be able to remove an item from my Basket
